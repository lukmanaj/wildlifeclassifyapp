# Wildlife Animal Prediction App

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning application designed for wildlife animal prediction from images. Built with Streamlit, PyTorch, and torchvision, it features a custom-trained DenseNet-201 model capable of identifying four specific animals: buffalo, elephant, rhino, and zebra. It offers an interactive way to apply deep learning for wildlife recognition.

Live app: [Wildlife Animal Prediction App](https://afriwildlifeclassify.streamlit.app/)

## Dataset

The model was trained using the "African Wildlife" dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset includes images of buffalo, elephant, rhino, and zebra, providing a diverse training set for the model.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images for prediction.
- **Animal Prediction**: Identifies whether the uploaded image is of a buffalo, elephant, rhino, or zebra.
- **Confidence Score**: Provides a probability score reflecting the model's confidence in its prediction.

## **Usage**

To use the app, either navigate to the live version or run it locally. Upload an image of one of the specified animals, and click "Predict" to see the result. The app will display the prediction and the confidence level of the model.

## **Model**
   
The pretrained DenseNet-201 model, adapted for our specific classification task, is included in this repository. It has been fine-tuned with the aforementioned Kaggle dataset to accurately distinguish between the four animal types.
